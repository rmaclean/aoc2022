# HELLO

These are the solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) in JavaScript

I am trying as much as possible to not use 3rd party code
I am not writing for reuse really, so there isn't going to be a lot of functions - this is more a single see how fast I can do it

If you have any questions of comments about this, feel free to reach out to me at [@rmaclean@twit.social](https://twit.social/@rmaclean) - would love to hear from you
